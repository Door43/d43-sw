Adamu na mke wake walifurahia sana kuishi katika bustani nzuri aliyowatengenezea Mungu. Hakuna kati yao aliyevaa nguo ila hili halikuwafanya waone haya, maana hakukuwa na dhambi ulimwenguni. Mara nyingi walitembea kwa lile bustani na kuongea na Mungu.

Lakini kulikuwa na nyoka mwenye hila katika bustani. Akamuuliza mwanamke, "Kweli Mungu aliwaambia msikule tunda kutoka kwa mti wowote pale bustani? "

Mwanamke akajibu, "Mungu alituambia tunaweza kula tunda la mti wowote ila tu mti wa ujuzi wa mema na mabaya. Mungu alituambia, 'ukikula tunda hilo ama uliguse, utakufa.'"

Nyoka akamjibu mwanamke, "Hiyo si kweli! Hautakufa. Mungu anajua ukilikula tu, utakuwa kama Mungu na utaweza kuelewa mema na maovu kama yeye."

Mwanamke akaona lile tunda ni nzuri na lina ladha. Na pia alitaka kuwa na hekima, kwa hivyo akachukua sehemu ya hilo tunda na akala. Pia akampa mmewe zingine, aliyekuwa pamoja naye, naye pia akala.

Ghafla macho yao yakafunguliwa , na wakatambua kwamba walikua uchi na wakajaribu kuufunika uchi wao kwa kujishonea mavazi wakitumia majani.

Basi mume na mke wake wakasikia sauti ya Mungu akitembea kupitia bustani. Wote wawili wakajificha kutoka kwa Mungu. Basi Mungu akamuita mwanaume, "uko wapi?" Adamu akajibu, "nilikusikia ukitembea bustani na nikaogopa, sababu nilikua uchi. Kwa hivyo nikajificha."

Then God asked, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?" The man answered, "You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit." Then God asked the woman, "What have you done?" The woman replied, "The snake tricked me."

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-09.jpg?direct&}}

God said to the snake, "You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman's descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel."

God then said to the woman, "I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you."

God said to the man, "You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt." The man named his wife Eve, which means "life-giver," because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

Then God said, "Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever." So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.
