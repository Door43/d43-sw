Hivi ndivyo mwanzo wa kila kitu ulivyokuwa. Mungu aliuumba ulimwengu na kila kilichomo ndani yake kwa muda wa siku sita. Baada ya Mungu kuumba, dunia ilikuwa tupu na giza nene lilitanda juu ya uso wa dunia, na hapakuwa na kitu chochote kilichokuwa tayari kimeshaumbwa juu ya dunia. Lakini Roho wa Mungu alitulia juu ya maji.

Basi Mungu akasema, "Na pawe na nuru!" Na nuru ikatokea. Tazama Mungu akaiona nuru kuwa ni njema, akaiita "Mchana." Ndipo Mungu akaitenganisha nuru na giza aliloliita "Usiku." Siku ya kwanza ya uumbaji Mungu aliumba nuru.{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-03.jpg?direct&}}

Siku ya pili ya uumbaji, Mungu alisema na kuumba anga juu ya dunia. Alilifanya anga kwa kuyagawa maji yaliyokuwa chini kwenda juu na mengine kubaki katika nchi.

Siku ya tatu, Mungu alinena na kutenganisha maji na nchi kavu. Akaiita nchi kavu "ardhi", na akaita maji "bahari." Mungu akaona ya kwamba alichokiumba ni kizuri.

Halafu Mungu akasema, "Na ardhi ikazalishe kila aina ya miti na mimea." Na ikawa hivyo. Mungu akaona kile alichokiumba ni Kizuri.

Katika siku ya nne ya umbaji, Mungu akanena na akatengeneza Jua , Mwezi na Nyota. Mungu akazitengeneza ziangazie Dunia na ili zitenge kati ya usiku na mchana , majira na miaka. Mungu akaona vyote alivyoumba vilikua nzuri.

Katika siku ya tano, Mungu akanena na akaumba vyote vya kuogelea majini na ndege wote. Mungu akaona ilikuwa nzuri na akawabariki.

Katika siku ya sita ya uumbaji, Mungu akasema, "Na kuwe na kila aina ya wanyama wa nchi kavu!" Na ikawa kama alivyonena Mungu. Wengine wa kawa wanyama wa kufugwa, wengine wa wanaotambaa kwa ardhi, wengine wanyama wa porini. Na Mungu akaona ni nzuri.

Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."

So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.

In the middle of the garden, God planted two special treesâ€”the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.

Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.

So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-14.jpg?direct&}}

When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.

God made man and woman in his own image. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" And God saw that everything he had made was very good, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of creation.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-16.jpg?direct&}}

When the seventh day came, God had finished his work. So God rested from all he had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.
