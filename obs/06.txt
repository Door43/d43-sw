When Abraham was very old, his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man. So Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land where his relatives lived to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac.- Wakati Ibrahimu alikuwa mkongwe sana, mwana wake, Isaka, alikuwa amekomaa kuwa mwanaume. Kwa hivyo Iburahimu akamtuma mmoja wa watumishi wake arudi kwa nchi ile jamaa zake waliishi ili aende amletee Isaka mwanawe mke.

After a very long journey to the land where Abraham's relatives lived, God led the servant to Rebekah. She was the granddaughter of Abraham's brother. Baada ya safari ndefu sana hadi kwa nchi ile jamaa za Iburahimu waliishi, Mungu alimuongoza yule mtumishi kwa Rebeka. Yeye alikuwa ni mjukuu wa kike wa duguye Ibrahimu.

Rebekah agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant to Isaac's home. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived. Rebeka alikubali kuacha jamii yake na kurudi na yule mtumishi hadi nyumbani mwa Isaka. Isaka akamuoa mala tu alipowasili.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. God had promised that Abraham would have countless descendants, but Isaac's wife, Rebekah, could not have children. Baada ya muda mrefu, Ibrahimu aliaga dunia na ahadi zote zile Mungu alikuwa amemefanya kwake katika agano zikapitishwa kwa Isaka. Mungu alikuwa ameahidi ya kuwa Iburahimu angekuwa na vizazi visivyoweza kuhesabika,lakini mkewe Isaka, Rebeka, hangeweza kuwa na watoto.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were still in Rebekah's womb, so Rebekah asked God what was happening. Isaka alimuombea Rebeka,naye Mungu akamuruhusu ashike mimba ya mapacha. Hao watoto wawili walimenyana mmoja na mwingine wakati wangali tumboni mwa Rebeka, naye Rebeka akamuuliza Mungu kile kilikuwa kinaendelea.

God told Rebekah, "Two nations will come from the two sons inside of you. They will struggle with each other and the older son will serve the younger one."

When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then the younger son came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob.
