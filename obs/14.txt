Baada ya Mungu kuwaambia Waisraeli zile sheria ambazo angetaka wafuate kama sehemu ya agano nao, wakatoka Mlima wa Sinai. Mungu akaanza kuwaongoza akawaelekeza Nchi ya ahadi, Ambayo pia iliitwa Kanani. Lile nguzo la wingu likaenda mbele yao kuelekea Kanani nao wakaifuata.

Mungu alikuwa amewaahidi Ibrahimu, Isaka na Yakobo kuwa atapeana ile Nchi ya Ahadi kwa uzao wao, lakini sasa kulikuwa vikundi nyingi za watu wanaoishi pale. Waliitwa Wakanani. Wakanani hawakumwabudu wala kumtii Mungu. Waliabudu miungu ya uongo na kufanya mambo mengi maovu.

Mungu akawaambia Waisraeli, “Lazima muwaondoe Wakanani wote katika Nchi ya Ahadi. Msifanye amani nao na msioane nao. Lazima muziangamize kabisa sanamu zao zote. Kama hamutakuwa watiifu kwangu, mtaabudu sanamu zao badala yangu.”

Wakati Waisraeli walifika mpaka wa Kanani, Musa akachagua wanaume kumi na wawili, mmoja kutoka kwa kila kabila la Israeli. Akawapa hawa wanaume maagizo waende na kupeleleza nchi kuona vile inavyokaa. Pia walikuwa wapeleleze kuona kama wana nguvu ama ni wanyonge.

Wale wanaume kumi na wawili walisafiri kupitia Kanani kwa siku arobanne na wakarudi. Wakaambia watu, “nchi ile iko na rotuba sana na inatoa mimea kwa wingi!” Lakini kumi kati ya wale wapelelezi wakasema, “Zile miji ziko na nguvu sana na watu ni majitu! Tukiwavamia, kwa uhakika watatushinda na kutuua!”

Wakati huo huo Kalebu na Yoshua, wale wapelelezi wengine wawili wakasema, “Ni kweli kuwa watu wa Kanani wote ni warefu na wenye nguvu, lakini hakika tutawashinda! Mungu atatupigania!”

Lakini watu hawakusikiliza Kalebu na Yoshua. Walikasirikia Musa na Haruni na kusema, “kwa nini mlituleta mahali hapa pabaya? Tungekaa Misiri badala ya kuuliwa katika vita na wake wetu na watoto wetu kufanywa watumwa.” Watu walitaka kuchagua kiongozi mwingine awarudishe Misri.

Mungu alikasirika sana na akaja kwa ile hema ya mkutano. Mungu akasema, “Kwa sababu mmeniasi, watu wote ni lazima watazungukazunguka jangwani. Isipokuwa Yoshua na Kalebu, kila mtu ambaye amefikisha miaka ishirini na zaidi atakufa hapo na hataingia Nchi ya Ahadi.”

**Wakati watu walisikia hiyo, walihuzunika kuwa walitenda dhambi. Wakachukua silaha zao na wakaenda kushambulia watu wa Kanani. Musa akawaonya wasiende kwa sababu Mungu hakuwa pamoja na wao, lakini hawakumusikiliza.**

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

During the forty years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called "manna." He also sent flocks of quail (which are medium-sized birds) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. Even so, God was still faithful to his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Another time when the people did not have any water, God told Moses, "Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it." But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, "You will not enter the Promised Land."

After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them who had rebelled against God were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so God chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God also promised Moses that one day, he would send another prophet like Moses.

Then God told Moses to go to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.
