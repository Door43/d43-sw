Baada ya muda mrefu, watu wengi wakawa wanaishi duniani. Wakawa wamejaa uovu na vurugu. Ikawa mbaya sana mpaka Mungu akaamua kuuharibu ulimwengu wote kupitia kwa mafuriko makubwa.

Lakini Nuhu akapata neema na Mungu. Yeye alikuwa mwenye haki, akiishi kati ya watu walio waovu. Mungu akamwambia Nuhu kuhusu mafuriko aliyokuwa anapanga kuleta. Akamwambia Nuhu alijenge mashua kubwa.

Mungu akamwambia Nuhu aitengeneze mashua kama mita 140 kwa urefu, na mita 23 kwa upana, na mita 13.5 kwenda juu. Nuhu alikuwa aijenge akitumia mbao na atengeneze ghorofa tatu, vyumba nyingi, paa na ndirisha. Ile mashua ingewaweka salama Nuhu, jamii yake, na wanyama wote wa nchi kavu wakati wa mafuriko.

Nuhu akamtii Mungu. Yeye na wanaye watatu wakajenga mashua kama vile Mungu alivyowaeleza. Ilichukua miaka mingi kujenga mashua, kwa sababu ilikuwa kumbwa mno. Nuhu akawaonya watu kuhusu mafuriko yatakayokuja na akawaambia wamgeukie Mungu, lakini hakumuamini.

Mungu pia akaamrisha Nuhu na jamii yake wakusanye chakula yao na ya wanyama. Kila kitu kilipokuwa tayari, Mungu akamwambia Nuhu ni wakati wake, mke wake, na wanao watatu, na wake zao kuingia kwa mashua - watu nane kwa jumla.

Mungu akatuma kutoka kwa kila aina ya mnyama na ndege, mmoja wa kike na mmoja wa kiume kwake Nuhu ili waingie kwa ile mashua na wawekwe salama wakati wa mafuriko. Mungu akatuma kutoka kwa kila aina ya mnyama, saba wa kiume na saba wa kike ndio baadaye zikatumike kumtolea Mungu dhabihu. Walipoingia wote kwa ile mashua, Mungu mwenyewe akafunga mlango.

Halafu ikaanza kunyesha, na ikandelea, na ikaendelea. Ikanyesha kwa muda wa siku arobanne usiku na mchana bila kukoma! Maji pia ilikuwa inatiririka kutoka kwa ardhi. Kila kitu katika duniani yote ikawa imefunikwa na maji, hata milima iliyo mirefu zaidi.

Everything that lived on the dry land died, except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept everything inside the boat safe from drowning.

After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.

After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-03-11.jpg?direct&}}

Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-03-12.jpg?direct&}}

Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was drying up!

Two months later God said to Noah, "You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth." So Noah and his family came out of the boat.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-03-14.jpg?direct&}}

After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal that could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.

God said, "I promise I will never again curse the ground because of the evil things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though people are sinful from the time they are children."

God then made the first rainbow as a sign of his promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what he promised and so would his people.
