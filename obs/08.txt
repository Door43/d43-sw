Many years later, when Jacob was an old man, he sent his favorite son, Joseph, to check on his brothers who were taking care of the herds. Miaka mingi baadaye, wakati Yakobo alikuwa mtu mkongwe, akamtuma mwanawe ambaye alikuwa anampendelea sana, Yosefu, kuangalia ndugu zake ambao walikuwa wakichunga ng'ombe.

Joseph's brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had dreamed that he would be their ruler. When Joseph came to his brothers, they kidnapped him and sold him to some slave traders. Ndugu zake Yosefu walimchukia yeye kwa sababu baba yake alimpenda kuliko wengine wote na kwa sababu Yosefu alikuwa ameota ya kuwa angeweza kuwa mtawala wao.  wakati Yosefu alikuja kwa dugu zake, wakamteka nyara  na wakamuuza kwa baadhi ya wafanya biashara ya watumwa.

Before Joseph's brothers returned home, they tore Joseph's robe and dipped it in goat's blood. Then they showed the robe to their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph. Jacob was very sad. Kabla ya dugu zake Yosefu kurudi nyumbani, walirarua vazi ya Yosefu na kuitubukiza ndani ya damu ya mbuzi.  Halafu wakaionyesha vazi hilo kwa baba yao ndio afikirie ya kuwa mnyama wa mwituni alikuwa ameua yosefu.  Yakobo alikuwa na huzuni sana.

The slave traders took Joseph to Egypt. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the Nile River. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy government official. Joseph served his master well, and God blessed Joseph. Wale wafanyibiashara ya watumwa walimpeleka Yosefu huko Misiri.  Misiri ilikuwa nchi kubwa, yenye nguvu na ilikuwa kando ya mto Nile.  Wale wafanyabiashara ya watumwa wakamuuza Yosefu kama mtumwa kwa tajiri aliyekuwa afisa wa serikali. Yosefu alimtumikia bwana wake vyema, naye Mungu akambariki Yosefu.

His master's wife tried to sleep with Joseph, but Joseph refused to sin against God in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph remained faithful to God, and God blessed him. Mke wa bwana wake alijaribu kulala na Yosefu, lakini Yosefu alikataa kutenda dhambi kinyume na Mungu wake kwa njia hii.  Yeye akawa mwenye hasira na akamshitaki Yosefu kwa uongo na hivyo akakamatwa na kupelekwa gerezani.

After two years, Joseph was still in prison, even though he was innocent. One night, the Pharaoh, which is what the Egyptians called their kings, had two dreams that disturbed him greatly. None of his advisors could tell him the meaning of the dreams. Baada ya miaka miwili, Yosefu alikuwa angali gerazani, hata kama hakuwa na hatia.  Usiku mmoja, Farauni, hivyo ndivyo Wamisiri waliita wafalme wao, akawa na ndoto mbili ambazo zilimsubua sana.  Hakuna hata mmoja wa washauri wake waliweza kumwambia maana ya ndoto hizo.

God had given Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, "God is going to send seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of famine." Mungu alikuwa amempatia Yosefu uwezo wa kutafsiri ndoto, hivyo Firauni akafanya Yosefu kuletwa kwake kutoka gerazani.  Yosefu akatafsiri ndoto hizo kwake na kusema, "Mungu anaenda kutuma miaka saba yenye mavuno mengi, ikifuatwa na miaka saba ya njaa."

Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph that he appointed him to be the second most powerful man in all of Egypt! Firauni alipendezwa na Yosefu na akamteua yeye kuwa ndiye mtu wa pili mwenye nguvu Misiri yote!

Joseph told the people to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of famine came so they would have enough to eat. Yosefu akaambia watu wahifadhi kiasi kikubwa cha chakula wakati waa miaka saba ya mavuno mengi.  Halafu Yosefu akauza hiyo chakula kwa watu wakati wa miaka saba ya njaa ilipofika ili wawe na chakula ya kutosha.{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-10.jpg?direct&}}

The famine was severe not only in Egypt, but also in Canaan where Jacob and his family lived. Njaa hiyo ilikuwa kali sana na siyo tuu huko Misiri, lakini hata huko Kanaani kule Yakobo na jamii yake waliishi.

So Jacob sent his older sons to Egypt to buy food. The brothers did not recognize Joseph when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them. Kwa hivyo Yakobo akawatuma wanawe wakubwa huko Misiri kununua chakula.  Dugu hao hawakumtambua Yosefu waliposimama mbele zake ili wanunue chakula.  Lakini Yosefu aliwatambua

After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph said to them, "I am your brother, Joseph! Do not be afraid. You tried to do evil when you sold me as a slave, but God used the evil for good! Come and live in Egypt so I can provide for you and your families." Baada ya kuwajaribu dugu zake aone kama walikuwa wamebadirika, Yosefu akasema na wao, " Mini ni dugu yenu, Yosefu! msiogope.  Mlijaribu kufanya maovu mliponiuza kama mtumwa, lakini Mungu alitumia huo uovu kwa wema! Njooni muishi huku Misiri ili niweze kuwapatia ninyi na jamii zenu."

When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy. Wakati ndugu zake Yosefu walirudi nyumbani na kumwambia baba yao, Yakobo, ya kuwa yosefu alikuwa angali hai, akawa na furaha sana.

Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt with all of his family, and they all lived there. Before Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons. Hata kama Yakobo alikuwa mkongwe sana, alihama kwenda Misiri pamoja na jamii yake, na wote wakaiishi huko.  Kabla ya Yakobo kufariki, alibariki kila mmoja wa wana wake.

The covenant promises that God gave to Abraham were passed on to Isaac, then to Jacob, and then to Jacob's twelve sons and their families. The descendants of the twelve sons became the twelve tribes of Israel. Ahadi za agano ambazo Mungu alikuwa amempatia Iburahimu zikapitishwa kwa Isaka, na kisha kwa Yakobo, na kisha kwa wana kumi na wawili wa Yakobo na jamii zao.  Vizazi vya hao wana kumi na wawili wakafanyika kabila kumi na mbili za Israeli.
