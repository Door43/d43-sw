When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had sinned**. They took their weapons and went to attack the people of **Canaan**. **Moses warned them not to go** because **God was not with them**, **but they did not listen to him**.

Wakati watu walisikia hiyo, walihuzunika kuwa **walitenda dhambi**. Wakachukua silaha zao na wakaenda kushambulia watu wa **Kanani.** Musa akawaonya wasiende kwa sababu **Mungu hakuwa pamoja na wao, lakini hawakumusikiliza. **

==== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): ====

  * **they had sinned**  - It may be necessary to add, "they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan."
  * **walitenda dhambi **- Yaweza kuwa ya muhimu kuongeza, "walikuwa wametenda dhambi kwa kutotii amri ya Mungu ya kuwashinda watu wa Kanani."
  * **Moses warned them not to go**  - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
  * **Musa aliwaonya wasiende**  - Hii inamanisha kuwa Musa aliwaambia wasiende kupigana na Wakanani kwa sababu wangekuwa kwa hatari kama wangeenda.
  * **God was not with them**  â€“ In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
  * **Mungu hakuwa nao**  - Kwa maneno mengine, Mungu hangekuwa nao kuwasaidia. Kwa sababu ya kutotii kwa Waisraeli, Mungu aliwaondokea kwa uwepo, ulinzi na nguvu.

  * **lakini hawakumsikiliza**  - Hawakumtii Musa. Hata hivyo, walienda kuwashabulia Wakanani.
