The two men invited **Jesus** to stay with them, so he did. When they were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked **God** for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that he was Jesus. But at that moment, **he disappeared from their sight**.

Watu wale wawili walialika **Yesu** akae nao, naye hivyo ndivyo alivyofanya. Walipokuwa tayari kula mlo wa jioni, Yesu alichukua mkate, alimshukuru **Mungu** kwa ajili yake, na kisha akaivunja. Kwa ghafla, wakamtambua kwamba nin yeye. Lakini wakati huo huo, **yeye akatoweka kutoka miongoni mwao.**
