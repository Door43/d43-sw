{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-01.jpg?nolink&}}

**Joseph’s** brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had **dreamed** that he would be their ruler. When Joseph **came to his brothers**, they **kidnapped** him and sold him to some **slave traders**.

Ndugu zake **Yosefu** walimuchukia kwa sababu baba yao alimpenda zaidi na kwa sababu Yosefu alikuwa **ameota** ya kuwa atafanyika mtawala wao. Wakati Yosefu **alikuja kwa ndugu zake**, **walimteka nyara** na wakamuuza kwa **wafanya biashara na watumwa**.
