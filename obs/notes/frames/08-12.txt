After **testing his brothers** to see **if they had changed**, **Joseph** said to them, “I am your brother, Joseph! **Do not be afraid**. You tried to do **evil** when you sold me as a **slave**, but **God** used the **evil for good!** Come and live in **Egypt** so I can provide for you and your families.”

Baada ya **kuwajaribu ndugu zake** kuona **kama wemebadilika**, **Yosefu** akawaambia, "Mimi ni ndugu yenu, Yosefu! **Msiogope**. Mlijaribu kufanya **maovu** mliponiuza kama **mtumwa**, lakini **Mungu** alitumia hiyo **maovu kuleta mema**! Kujeni muishi Misri ndio niweze kuwalisha nyinyi na jamii zenu."

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **testing his brothers**  - Joseph placed his older brothers in a difficult situation to see if they would protect their youngest brother, or treat him as badly as they had treated Joseph. When they protected their youngest brother, Joseph knew they had changed.
  * **kujaribu ndugu zake**  - Yosefu aliwaweka ndugu zake wakubwa katika hali ngumu kuona kama watamlinda ndugu yao mdogo, ama kama watamfanyia vibaya kama yalivyomfanyia Yosefu. Walipomlinda ndugu yao mdogo Yosefu akajua wamebadirika.
  * **if they had changed**  - Another way to say this would be, "if they were different than they used to be." Years ago Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they would now do what was right.
  * **kama wamebadilika**  - Njia ingine ya kueleza hii ni, "kama wamekuwa tofauti na vile walivyokuwa mbeleni." Miaka mingi iliyopita ndugu za Yosefu walimuuza kwa utumwa. Yosefu alitaka kujua kama sasa wangefanya kile kilicho cha haki.
  * **do not be afraid**  - Another way to say this would be, "You do not need to fear any punishment from me." Joseph's brothers were afraid because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he had the power to punish them. Joseph could refuse to sell them food, or even put them in prison or kill them.
  * **usiogope**  - Njia ingine ya kusema hii inaweza kuwa, "hamna haja kuogopa adhabu yoyote kutoka kwangu." Ndugu zake Yosefu waliogopa kwa sababu walikuwa wamemkosea Yosefu sana na sasa kama mtawala mkubwa alikuwa na nguvu wa kuwaadhibu. Yosefu angekataa kuwauzia chakula, awaweke ngerezani ama awaue.
  * **evil for good**  - Joseph's brothers did an evil thing when they sold Joseph as a slave and he was taken to Egypt. But God allowed this so that Joseph could save thousands of people from starving during the famine, including his own family. This was a very good thing.
  * **Maovu kwa mema**  - Ndugu zake Yosefu walifanya maovu wakati waliuza Yosefu kama mtumwa na akapelekwa Misri. Lakini Mungu aliruhusu hii ili Yosefu akaweze kuokoa maelfu ya watu wasikufe wakati wa njaa, pamoja na jamii yake. Hii ilikuwa nzuri sana.
