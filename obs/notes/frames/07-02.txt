One day, when **Esau** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to **Jacob**, “Please **give me some of the food** you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then Jacob gave him some food.

Siku moja, wakati **Esau** alirudi kutoka kwa kuwinda, alikuwa na njaa sana. Esau akamwambia **Yakobo**, "Tafadhari **nigawie chakula** uliokipika." Yakobo akajibu, "Kwanza, **nipe haki yako ya mzaliwa wa kwanza**." Kwa hivyo, Esau akampa Yakobo **haki yake ya mzaliwa wa kwanza**. Naye Yakobo akampa chakula.

  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:esau|Esau (Esau)]]**
  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:jacob|Jacob (Yakobo)]]**
===== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): =====

  * **give me some of the food … give me your rights**  – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for "give" here. This would also apply to, "Esau gave … Jacob gave" in the last two sentences.
  * **nigawie chakula...nipe haki zako**  - Lugha zingine zaweza pendelea kutumia maneno mawili tofauti za "nipe" hapa. Hii inaweza tumika pia kwa, "Esau alipeana...Yakobo alipeana" katika sentensi mbili za mwisho.
  * **rights as the oldest son**  - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
  * **Haki za mzaliwa wa kwanza**  - kulingana na desturi zao, kwa sababu Esau ndiye aliyekuwa mzaliwa wa kwanza, yeye ndiye alikuwa apate urithi maradufu wa mali ya baba yao akikufa. Yakobo akafikilia njia ya kuchukua hizi haki za mzaliwa wa kwanza kutoka kwa Esau.
