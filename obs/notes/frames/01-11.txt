{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-11.jpg?nolink&}}

**In the middle** of the **garden**, God planted two special trees—the **tree of life** and the **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would **die**.

**Katikati ya bustani** lile, Mungu akapanda miti miwili spesheli--**mti wa uzima** na **mtu wa ujuzi wa mema na maovu**. Mungu akamwambia Adamu anaweza kula kutoka kwa kila mti uliomo bustani, isipokuma mti wa ujuzi wa mema na mabaya. Akikula kutoka kwa mti huu **atakufa**.
