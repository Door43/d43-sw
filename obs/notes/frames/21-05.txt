Kupitia kwa nabii Yeremia, Mungu aliahidi ya kuwa atafanya **Agano Jipya**, **lakini sio kama** ile **Agano ** Mungu alifanya na **Israeli ** katika **Sinai**. Katika Agano Jipya, Mungu **angeandika sheria zake juu ya roho za watu**, watu **wangemjua Mungu** kibinafsi, **wangekuwa watu wake**, naye Mungu **angewasamehe** **dhambi** zao. **Masihi ** alikuwa **aanze Agano Jipya**.

==== Translation Notes: Maelezo ya Tafsiri ====

  * **Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised**  – This could be translated as, "Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah, God promised" or, "The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>promise."</font>
  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Kupitia kwa nabii Yeremia Mungu aliahidi - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "kupitia kwa jumbe zile Mungu alimpatia Yeremia, Mungu aliahidi" ama' "Nabii Yeremia aliambia watu ahadi ya Mungu."</font>
  * **but not like**  - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice of himself one time for all who believe in him.
  * Lakini sio kama - Agano Jipya ilikuwa iwe kamilifu kabisa. Watu kwa ukweli wangemjua Mungu, wangeishi kama watu wake, na kabisa angewasamehe dhambi, kulingana na dhabihu ya masihkujitoa yeye mwenyewe mara moja na ya kutosha kwa<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>wale watamwamini.</font>
  * **write his law on the people's hearts**  -<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>This is a metaphor meaning, "help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly desire to obey them." If possible, keep the image of writing on their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible, you could just translate the meaning.</font>
  * **be his people**  - This could be translated as, "be his special people" or, "be his favored people."
  * **start the New Covenant**  - That is, "be the one to cause the New Covenant to take effect" or, "bring the New Covenant to his people."
