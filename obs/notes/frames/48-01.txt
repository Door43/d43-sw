{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-48-01.jpg?nolink&}}

When **God created the world**, everything was **perfect**. **There was no sin**. **Adam** and **Eve** loved each other, and they loved God. **There was no sickness or death**. This was the way God wanted the world to be.

Wakati **Mungu aliumba Ulimwengu**, kila kitu kilikuwa kikamilifu. Hakukuwa na dhambi. Adamu na Hawa walipendana mmoja na mwingine, na walimpenda Mungu. Hakukuwa na magonjwa au kifo. Hivi ndio njia ambayo Mungu alitaka ulimwengu uwe.

===== Translation Notes: (Maelezo ya Tafsiri) =====

  * **God created the world**  - That is, "God made the world out of nothing."
  * **perfect**  - That is, "exactly as it should be" to accomplish all that God intended for it.
  * **There was no sin**  - For some languages it is not possible to express "sin" as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases this could be translated as, "No one ever sinned" or, "People did not sin" or, "Nothing evil had happened."
