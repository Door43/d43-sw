“Other seeds fell on **rocky ground**, where there was very little soil. The seeds in the rocky ground sprouted quickly, but their roots were not able to go deep into the soil. When the sun came up and it got hot, the plants withered and died.”

"Mbegu zingine zilianguka kwa **ardhi yenye miamba**, mahali ambapo kulikuwa na mchanga kindogo. Zile mbegu kwa ardhi yenye miamba ziliota kwa haraka, lakini mizizi yake haikuingia kwa kina katika undongo. Wakati jua lilichomoka na kukawa na joto, mimea ile ilinyauka na kukauka."
