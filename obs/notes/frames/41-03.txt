The day after **Jesus** was buried was a **Sabbath** day, and **the Jews were not permitted** to go to a **tomb** on that day. So very early on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to Jesusâ€™ **tomb** to put more **burial spices** on his body.

Siku moja baada ya **Yesu** kuzikwa ikawa siku ya **Sabato**, na **wale Wayahudi hawakuruhusiwa** kwenda **kaburini** siku hiyo. Kwa hivyo mapema sana asubuhi baada ya siku ya Sabato, wanawake kadhaa walienda **kaburini** ya Yesu kuongeza **viungo za mazishi ** kwa mwili wake.
