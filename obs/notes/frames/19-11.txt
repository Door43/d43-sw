Immediately, fire **fell from the sky** and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the **altar**. When the people saw this, they **fell on the ground** and said, “**Yahweh is God**! Yahweh is God!”

Mara moja, moto **ikaanguka kutoka angani** na kuteketeza ile nyama, kuni, mawe, makapi, na hata maji iliyozunguka **madhabahu**. Watu walipoona hivyo, **walianguka chini** na kusema, "**Yehova ni Mungu**! Yehova ni Mungu!"

  * **fell from the sky**  - This may be translated as, "suddenly came down from the sky."
  * **ikaanguka kutoka angani **- Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "kwa ghafla ikatelemka toka angani."

  * **walianguka chini **- Kwa haraka walilala chini ama wakapiga magoti kwa ardhi. Waliogopa Yehova kwa sababu waliona nguvu zake. Walijua kuwa ni Mungu wa kweli peke yake angeweza kufanya hivyo na wakainama chini kumheshimu na kumuabudu.
  * **Yahweh is God**  - This expression means that they understood that Yahweh is the only God, not just one god among others.
  * **Yehova ni Mungu**  - Hii msemo inamaanisha kuwa walielewa kuwa Yehova ndiye Mungu peke yake, na si tu mungu miongoni mwa wengine.
