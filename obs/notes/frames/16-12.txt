Then **Gideon** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a **horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where the **Midianite** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.

Kisha **Gideoni** akarudi kwa askari wake na akampa kila mmoja wao **baragumu**, nyungu ya udongo, na **mwenge**. Wakazingira kambi mahali askari **Wamidiani** walikuwa wanalala. Askari 300 wa Gideoni walikuwa na mwenge katika nyungu na kwa hivyo Wamidiani hawangeona mwangaza wa zile mwenge.

==== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): ====

  * **horn**  - This could be translated as, "trumpet" or, "ram's horn trumpet." These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle.
  * **baragumu**  - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "tarumpeta" ama, "tarumpeta ya baragumu ya kondoo wa kiume." Hizi baragumu zilitoka kwa kondoo wa kiume na zilitumika kuwaita wanaume waje kwa vita.
  * **a torch**  - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)
  * **mwenge**  - Hii pengine ilikuwa kipande cha mti kimefungwa na nguo na kutumbukizwa kwa mafuta ili iweze kuchomeka vizuri. (Hii haikuwa mwenge ya kisasa ambayo inatumia betri.)
