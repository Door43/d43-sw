===== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): =====

  * **he knew it was not his baby**  - That is, "he knew that he was not the one who had caused her to be pregnant."
  * **Alijua mtoto hakuwa wake**  - Hii ni, "alijua kwamba sio yeye aliyemtia mimba."
  * **to shame Mary**  - That is, "to cause Mary to be publicly disgraced" or "to embarrass Mary publicly." Joseph was merciful to Mary, even though it seemed like she was an adulterer.
  * **Kuaibisha Mariamu**  - Hiyo ni, " kusababisha Mariamu kuaibishwa hadharani" ama, "kumuonyesha Mariamu aibu hadharani." Yosefu alikuwa na huruma kwa Mariamu, ata kama ilionekana ni kama alikuwa mzinifu."
  * **he planned to quietly divorce her**  - This could also be translated as, "He planned to divorce her without telling others why," or, "He planned to divorce her without telling others about her pregnancy." Because Joseph was righteous, he wanted to resolve the situation in the best way possible, which in this culture would be to divorce her quietly.
  * **alipanga kumtaliki kisiri**  - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "Alipanga kumtaliki bila kuambia wengine kwa nini," ama, "Alipanga kumtaliki bila kuambia wengine kuhusu mimba yake." Kwa sababu Yosefu alikuwa mwenye haki, alitaka kusuruhisha hali hiyo kwa njia bora zaidi iwezekanavyo, ambayo katika tamaduni hii ilikuwa kumtaliki kisiri.
  * **divorce her**  - For some languages it may be better to say, "break their engagement." Joseph and Mary were engaged or, "pledged to be married." But in Jewish culture a divorce was required in order to break off an engagement.
  * **Kumtaliki yeye**  - Kwa lugha zingine inaweza kuwa bora kusema, "kuvuja uchumba wao." Yusufu na Mariamu walikuwa wamepoozana ama "Kuahidiana kuoana." Lakini katija tamaduni za Kiyahudi talaka ilihitanjika ili kivunja uchumba.
  * **in a dream**  - That is, "while he was asleep and dreaming."
  * **Katika ndoto**  - Hio ni, "alipokuwa amelala na kuota."
