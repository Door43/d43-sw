As the **disciples** were talking, **Jesus** suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, “**Peace to you**!” The **disciples** thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, “Why are you afraid and **doubting**? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” **To prove** that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.

Wanafunzi walipokuwa wanazungumza, Yesu ghafla aliwtokea katika chumba na akasema, "Amani kwenu!" Wanafunzi walidhani ni mzimu, lakini Yesu alisema, "Kwa nini muna hofu na mashaka? Tazameni mikono yangu na miguu. Vizuka hawana miili kama mimi. "Ili muthibitisha kuwa mimi si mzimu, aliuliza kwa ajili ya kitu cha kula. Wakampa kipande cha samaki aliyepikwa, naye akala.
