As the **disciples** were talking, **Jesus** suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, “**Peace to you**!” The **disciples** thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, “Why are you afraid and **doubting**? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” **To prove** that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.

**Wanafunzi** walipokuwa wanazungumza, **Yesu** kwa ghafla aliwatokea katika chumba na akasema, **"Amani kwenu!"** **Wanafunzi** walidhani ni mzimu, lakini Yesu alisema, "Kwa nini muna hofu na **mashaka**? Tazameni mikono yangu na miguu. Mizimu hawana miili kama mimi. "**Ili athibitishe ** kuwa yeye si mzimu, aliitisha kitu ya kukula. Wakampa kipande cha samaki aliyepikwa, naye akala.
