===== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): =====

  * **Rebekah's babies were born**  - Some languages have another way of saying this such as, "when Rebekah saw and took them" or, "when Rebekah brought them to light."
  * **Watoto wa Rebeka wakazaliwa**  - Lugha zingine ziko na njia ingine ya kusema haya kama, "Rebeka alipowaona na kuwashika" ama "wakati Rebeka aliwaleta kwa mwanga."
  * **the older son … the younger son**  - This could be translated as, "the first son to come out … the second son to come out." Make sure that the way "older" and "younger" are translated still communicates that the boys were twins.
  * **Mwana aliye mkubwa…mwana aliye mdogo**  - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "mwana aliyetoka kwanza…mwana aliyetoka wa pili." Hakikisha kuwa vile "mkubwa" na "mdogo" zinatafsiriwa zitaonyesha kuwa hawa vijana walikuwa mapacha.
  * **red**  - This may mean that his skin was very red or that the hair on his body was red.
  * **nyekundu**  - Hii inaweza maanisha kuwa ngozi ilikuwa nyekundu sana ama kuwa nywele katika mwili wake ilikuwa nyekundu.
  * **hairy**  - Esau had a lot of hair on his body. You could say, "the older son's body was red, with lots of hair."
  * **kuwa na nywele**  - Esau alikuwa na nywele nyingi mwilini mwake. Unaweza sema, "mwili wa mwana aliyekuwa mkubwa, ulikuwa mwekundu na nywele nyingi."
