“After that, **a severe famine happened** in the land where the younger son was, and he had **no money to buy food**. So he took the only job he could find, **feeding pigs**. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”

"Baada ya hayo, **njaa mbaya ilitokea** katika nchi aliyokuwa yule mwana mdogo, na **hakuwa na fedha ya kununua chakula**. Kwa hivyo akaanza kufanya kazi ambayo peke yake ilikuweko, **kulisha nguruwe**. Maisha yake ikawa duni na akawa na njaa kiasi kuwa alitamani kula chakula ya nguruwe."
