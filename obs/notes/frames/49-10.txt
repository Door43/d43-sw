{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-10.jpg?nolink&}}

**Because of your sin**, you are **guilty** and deserve to **die**. **God should be angry** with you, but **he poured out his anger on Jesus** instead of on you. When Jesus died on the **cross**, he **received your punishment**.

Kwa sababu ya dhambi zako, una hatia na unastahili kufa. Mungu wanapaswa kuwa na hasira na wewe, lakini yeye alimwaga hasira yake juu ya Yesu badala yako. Wakati Yesu alikufa msalabani, alipokea adhabu yako.
