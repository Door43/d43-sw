**God** told **Noah** to make **the boat** about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.

**Mungu** akamwambia **Nuhu** aitengeneze **mashua** kama mita 140 kwa urefu, na mita 23 kwa upana, na mita 13.5 kwenda juu. Noah alikuwa aijenge akitumia mbao na atengeneze ngazi tatu, vyumba nyingi, paa na ndirisha. Ile mashua ingewaweka salama Nuhu, jamii yake, na wanyama wote wa nchi kavu wakati wa mafuriko.
