**Jesus** approached them and started walking with them, but they **did not recognize him**. He asked what they were talking about, and they told him about **all the remarkable things that had happened** concerning Jesus during the previous few days. They thought they were talking to a visitor who did not know what had happened in **Jerusalem**.

**Yesu** aliwakaribia na kuanza kutembea pamoja nao, lakini wao **hawakumtambua.** Aliuliza kile walichokuwa wanakizungumzia, na walimwambia kuhusu **mambo yote ya ajabu yaliyotokea** kuhusu habari za Yesu siku chache zilizopita. Walidhani walikuwa wanazungumza na mgeni ambaye hakujua yaliyotokea huko **Yerusalemu**.
