As **Peter** was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and **a voice from the cloud said**, “This is my **Son** whom I **love**. I am pleased with him. **Listen to him**.” The three **disciples** were **terrified** and **fell on the ground**.

**Petero** alipokuwa akizungumza, wingu nyeupe lilishuka na kuwazunguka, **na sauti kutoka kwa wingu ikasema**, "Huyu ndiye **Mwanangu** **nimpendaye**. Ninafurahishwa naye. **Sikilizeni yeye**." Wale **wanafunzi** watatu wakawa na **hofu** na **wakaanguka chini.**
