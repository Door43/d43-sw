{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-42-01.jpg?nolink&}}

On the day that **Jesus** was **raised** from the dead, two of his **disciples** were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they talked about what had happened to Jesus. They had hoped that he was the **Messiah**, but then he was killed. Now the women said he was **alive** again. They did not know what to **believe**.

Siku ile **Yesu** **alifufuka** kutoka wafu, **wanafunzi** wake wawili walikuwa wanaenda mji ulio karibu. Walipokuwa wanatembea, walizungumzia mambo yaliyofanyika kwa Yesu. Walikuwa na matumaini kwamba yeye ndiye **Masihi**, lakini sasa yeye aliuawa. Sasa wanawake walisema kuwa yuko **hai ** tena. Hawakujua nini cha kuamini.
