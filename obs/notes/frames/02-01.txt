**Adam** and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden **God** had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any **shame**, because there was no **sin** in the world. They often walked in the garden and **talked with God**.

Adamu na mke wake walifurahia sana kuishi katika bustani nzuri aliyowatengenezea **Mungu**.  Hakuna kati yao aliyevaa nguo ila hili halikuwafanya waone **haya**, maana hakukuwa na **dhambi ** ulimwenguni. Mara nyingi walitembea kwa lile bustani na **kuongea na Mungu**.

==== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): ====

  * **garden**  - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in **[[:sw:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]**. See how you translated it there.
  * **bustani **- mkusanyiko maalum wa miti na mimea ile Mungu aliwaandalia Adamu na Hawa wafurahie na kuikula. Hili ni lile tu neno lililotumika  [01-11]. Angalia ulivyolitafsri pale.
  * **shame**  - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way. Before sin came into the world, there was no sense of shame about being naked.
  * **Aibu**  - Ni vile tunavyosikia  tunapojua tumetenda dhambi ama kwamba tumepungukiwa kwa njia fulani. kabla ya dhambi kuingia duniani, hakukua hisia za aibu sababu ya kuwa uchi.
  * **talked with God**  - The word for "talk" should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
  * **Akanena na Mungu**  - neno hili "kuongea" ni kama lile linatumika kueleza kuhusu kuongea na mwanadamu.  Ni kana kwamba Mungu alichukua mwili ndiyo akaongee na mwanamme na mwanamke, maana andiko laonyesha waliongea naye uso kwa uso.
