One day while **Moses** was **taking care of his sheep**, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the **bush did not burn up**. Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, **the voice of God said**, “Moses, take **off your shoes**. You are standing on **holy ground**.”

Siku moja **Musa** alikuwa **anatunza kondoo wake**, akaona kichaka abacho kinawaka moto. Lakini kile **kichaka hakikuwa kinachomeka**. Musa akaenda kuikaribi ile kichaka diposa akaione vizuri.  Alipokaribia kile kichaka kilichowaka moto, **sauti ya Mungu** ikasema, "Musa, **vua viatu vyako**. Unasimama **pahali patakatifu**."
