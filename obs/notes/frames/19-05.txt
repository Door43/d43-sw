After three and a half years, **God** told **Elijah** to return to the **kingdom of Israel** and **speak with Ahab because he was going to send** rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, **you troublemaker**!” Elijah replied to him, “You are the troublemaker! **You have abandoned Yahweh**, the true God, and **worshiped Baal**. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to **Mount Carmel**.” Baada ya miaka mitatu na nusu, **Mungu ** akamwambia **Elia ** arudi kwa **ufalme wa Israeli** na **anene pamoja na Ahabu kwa sababu alikuwa anaenda kutuma** mvua tena. Wakati Ahabu alimuona Elia akasema, "uko hapo wewe, **wewe mtaabishaji!"**Elia akamjibu, "wewe ndiwe mtaabishaji! **wewe umeamuacha Yahweh**, mungu wa kweli, na **Kuabudu Baali**.  **Leta watu wote wa ufalme wa Israeli Mlimani Kameli**."
