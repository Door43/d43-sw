**Makundi ** mengi **ya watu** bado hawajasikia habari za **Yesu**. Kabla ya Yesu kurudi **mbinguni**, aliwaambia **Wakristo** watangaze **habari njema** kwa watu ambao hawajaisikia. Alisema, "enendeni, **mkawafanye** makundi yote ya watu **wanafunzi** wangu!" Na, **"mashamba ni bivu kwa mavuno!"**
