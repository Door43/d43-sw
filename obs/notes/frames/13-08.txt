{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-13-08.jpg?nolink&}}

**God** also gave the **Israelites a detailed description** of a tent he wanted them to make. **It was called** the **Tent of Meeting**, and it had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the **high priest** was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God lived there**.

**Mungu** pia aliwapatia **Waisraeli maneno ya kina ** ya hema aliyowataka waitengeneze. **Iliitwa hema ya mkutano ** na ilikuwa na vyumba viwili zilizotenganishwa na pazia kubwa. Ni **kuhani mkuu ** peke yake aliyeruhusiwa kuingia **nyuma ya pazia** maana **Mungu aliishi mle**.
