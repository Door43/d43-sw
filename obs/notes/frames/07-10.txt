But **Esau** had already **forgiven Jacob**, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then **lived peacefully** in **Canaan**. Then **Isaac** died, and Jacob and Esau **buried him**. The **covenant promises God** had promised to **Abraham** now **passed on from Isaac to Jacob**.

Lakini **Esau** alikuwa tayari **amemsamehe Yakobo**,  na walifurahia kuonana tena. Basi Yakobo **akaishi kwa amani Kanani.** Halafu **Isaka** akafa, na Yakobo wakiwa na Esau **wakamzika**. Na **ahadi za agano** ambazo Mungu alikuwa amemuahidi Ibrahimu **zikaptisha kutoka kwa Isaka hadi kwa Yakobo**.
