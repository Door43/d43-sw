When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what **Jesus** had done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have the demons**. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

Wakati watu waliokuwa wanalinda zile nguruwe waliona **kile kimefanyika,** walikimbia mjini na kuambia kila mtu kile **Yesu** amefanya. Watu kutoka mjini walikuja na wakamuona yule mtu **ambaye alikuwa na mapepo**. Alikuwa anaketi kwa utulivu, amevaa manguo na anatenda kama mtu wa kawaida.
