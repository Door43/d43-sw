{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-46-09.jpg?nolink&}}

Some believers who fled from the **persecution** in **Jerusalem** went far away to the **city of Antioch** and preached about **Jesus**. Most of the people in Antioch were not **Jews**, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. **Barnabas** and **Saul** went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to **strengthen the church**. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called “**Christians**.”

Baadhi ya waaminio ambao walitoroka kutoka kwa mateso huko Yerusalemu walienda mbali hadi mji wa Antiokia na walihubiri juu ya Yesu. Wengi wa watu huko Antiokia hawakuwa Wayahudi, lakini kwa mara ya kwanza, wengi sana kati yao wakawa waaminio.  Baranaba na Sauli walienda pale kuwafundisha wale waaminio zaidi kumhusu yesu na kulitia kanisa nguvu. Ilikuwa huko Antiokia waaminio katika Yesu walikuwa wa kwanza kuitwa Wakristo.
