Then it began to **rain, and rain, and rain**. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the **whole world was covered with water**, even the highest mountains.

Halafu ikaanza **kunyesha, na ikandelea, na ikaendelea**. Ikanyesha kwa muda wa siku arobanne usiku na mchana bila kukoma! Maji pia ilikuwa inatoka kwa ardhi. Kila kitu katika duniani yote ikawa imefunikwa na maji, hata vilele vya milima iliyo mirefu zaidi.
