{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-01.jpg?nolink&}}

After **Joshua** died, the **Israelites disobeyed God** and **did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites** or **obey God's laws**. The Israelites began to **worship** the Canaanite **gods** instead of **Yahweh**, **the true God**. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did **what they thought was right for them**.

Baada ya **Yoshua** kufa, **Waisraeli walikataa kutii Mungu** na **hawakuwafukuza Wakanani hao wengine** wala **kutii sheria za Mungu**. Waisraeli wakaanza **kuabudu** **miungu** ya Wakanani badala ya **Yehova, Mungu wa kweli**. Waisraeli hawakuwa na mfalme, na yeyote yule **alifanya kile walichokifikiria kuwa sawa kwao**.

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **and did not drive out**  – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, "They did not."
  * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites**  - This can be translated, "fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land."
  * **or obey God's laws**  - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
  * **the true God**  - That is, "the only real God." Yahweh is the only one that people should worship.
  * **what they thought was right for them**  – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.
