“When the older **son** found out that they were celebrating because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and **begged** him to come and celebrate with them, but he refused.”

"Wakati mwana aliye mkubwa aligundua kuwa wanasherehekea kwa sababu nduguye amerudi nyumbani, akwa na hasira sana na alikataa kuingia kwa nyumba. Baba yake akaja nje na **kumsihi ** aingie na kusherehekea nao, lakini akakataa."
