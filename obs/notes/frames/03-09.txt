After **the rains stopped**, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one day the **boat rested** on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After **three more months**, the tops of the **mountains were visible**.

Baada ya **mvua kusimama**, ile mashua ikaelea juu ya maji kwa muda wa miezi tano, na maji yakaanza kudidimia. Halafu siku moja ile **mashua ikatua** juu ya mlima, lakini dunia ilikuwa bado imefunikwa na maji. Baada ya **miezi mitatu zaidi**, **vilele vya milima vikaonekana**.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the rains stopped**  â€“ This could be translated as, "it stopped raining."
  * **Mvua ikasimama**  - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "mvua ikasimama."
  * **boat rested**  - There was so much water from the rain that it covered the mountains. The ship floated over the mountains, and when the water started to go down, the ship went down with the water and settled on a mountain.
  * **Mashua ikatua**  - Kulikuwa na maji nyingi sana kutoka kwa mvua iliyofunika milima. Ile mashua ilielea juu ya milima na wakati maji ilipoanza kupungua, ile mashua ikashuka pamoja na maji na ikatua kwa mlima.
  * **three more months**  - During the next three months, the water continued to go down.
  * **miezi mitatu zaidi **- Katika miezi mitatu iliyofuata, maji ikaendelea na kupungua.
  * **mountains were visible**  - Other ways to translate this would be, "were showing" or, "appeared" or, "could be seen." It may be more clear to say, "After three months, the water had gone down enough so that Noah and his family could clearly see the tops of the mountains.
  * **Milimi ikaonekana**  - njia zingine za kutafsiri hii yaweza kuwa, "zikaonekana" ama " zikatokea" ama "zingeonekana." Itaeleweka vizuri kusema, baada ya miezi mitatu, maji ilikiuwa imeenda chini kiasi ya kuwa Nuhu na jamii yake wangeona vilele vya milima wazi.
