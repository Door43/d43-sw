The woman answered, “**God** told us we could eat the **fruit** of any tree except from the **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, **you will die**.’”

Mwanamke akajibu, "M**ungu** alituambia tunaweza kula **tunda** la mti wowote ila tu **mti wa ujuzi wa mema na mabaya. ** Mungu alituambia, 'ukikula tunda hilo ama uliguse, **utakufa**.'"

  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:god|God]]**
  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:good|good]]**
  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:evil|evil]]**
  * **[[:sw:obs:notes:key-terms:death|die]]**

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **fruit**  - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
  * **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
  * **you will die**  - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
