After a long time, **Abraham** died and all of **the promises that God had made to him in the covenant were passed on** to **Isaac**. God had promised that Abraham would have **countless descendants**, but Isaac's wife, **Rebekah**, could not have children.

Baada ya muda mrefu, **Ibrahimu ** akafa na **ahadi zote zile Mungu alikuwa amefanya naye katika agano zikapitishwa** kwa **Isaka**. Mungu alikuwa ameahidi kwamba Ibrahimu atakuwa na **uzao usiohesabika**, lakini mke wa Isaka, **Rebeka**, hangepata watoto.
