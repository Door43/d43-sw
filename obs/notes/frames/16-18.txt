**Finally**, the people **asked God for a king like all the other nations had**. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead them into battle. **God did not like this request**, but he gave them a king just as they had asked.

**Hatimaye**, watu **waliuliza Mungu mfalme kama vile mataifa mengine walivyokuwa nao**. Walitaka mfalme ambaye ni mrefu na ana nguvu, ambaye angewaongoza katika vita. **Mungu hakupendezwa na hili ombi**, lakini aliwapa mfalme kama walivyoomba.
