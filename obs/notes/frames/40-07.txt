Then **Jesus** cried out, “**It is finished**! **Father**, I give my **spirit into your hand**s.” Then he **bowed his head** and **gave up his spirit**. When he **died**, there was an earthquake and the **large curtain** that separated the people from the presence of **God** in the **Temple** was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Kisha **Yesu** akasema kwa sauti, **"Imekwisha! Baba**, naweka **roho yangu mikononi mwako."** Kisha **akainamisha kichwa**, na **akatoa roho yake.** **Alipokufa** kukawa na tetemeko la ardhi na ile **pazia kubwa** iliyo tenga watu kutoka kwa uwepo wa **Mungu** Hekaluni ikapasuka vipande viwili, toka juu mpaka chini.
