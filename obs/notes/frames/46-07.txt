After many days, the **Jews** made a plan to kill **Saul**. They sent people to watch for him at **the city gates** in order to kill him. But Saul heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they **lowered him over the city wall in a basket**. After Saul escaped from Damascus, he continued to **preach** about **Jesus**.

Baada ya siku nyingi, **Wayahudi ** walipanga mpango wa kumuua **Sauli**. Walituma watu kumuangalia **langoni la mji** ndiposa wamuue.  Sauli akasikia kuhusu ule mpango, na marafiki zake wakamsaidia kutoroka.  Usiku moja **wakamteremsha chini kwa ukuta na kikapu**.  Baada ya Sauli kutoroka Damesiki, aliendelea **kuhubiri ** juu ya **Yesu**.
