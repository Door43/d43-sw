“But his father told one of his **servants**, ‘Go quickly and bring the best clothes and put them on my **son**! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the **best calf** so we can have a feast and celebrate, because **my son was dead**, **but now he is alive**! **He was lost**, **but now he is found**!’”

"Lakini baba yake akamwambia mmoja wa **watumishi** wake, 'Enda haraka, leta nguo zilizo bora zaidi, valisha **mwanangu!** Weka pete kwa kidole yake na viatu kwa miguu yake. Kisha chinja **ndama**** aliye bora** ili tuwe na karama na kusherehekea, kwa sababu **mwanangu alikuwa amekufa, lakini sasa yu hai! Alikuwa amepotea, lakini sasa a amepatikana!'"**

  * **mwanangu alikuwa amekufa, lakini sasa yu hai!**  - Hiyo ni, "Ni kana kwamba mwanangu alikuwa amekufa na sasa yuko hai tena!" ama, "niliomboleza kana kuwa mwanangu alikufa, lakini sasa nina furaha ni kana kwamba amerudi uhai!"
