“The next person to **walk down** that road was a **Samaritan**. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

"Aliyefuata **kuteremka** katika ile barabara alikuwa ni **Msamaria**. (Wasamaria walikuwa wazaliwa wa Wayahudi ambao walioa watu wa mataifa zingine. Wasamaria na Wayahudi walichukiana.) Lakini wakati yule Msamaria alimuona yule mwanamme Myahudi, akamuonea huruma. Kwa hivyo alimutunza na kufunga vindonda vyake."
