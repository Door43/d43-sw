===== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsri): =====

  * **After a long time**  - This story happens many generations (hundreds of years) after creation.
  * **Baada ya muda mrefu**  - Kisa hiki kinafanyika vizazi nyingi (mamia ya miaka) baada ya uumbaji.
  * **very wicked and violent**  - It may be more natural to say, "had become wicked and did violent things".
  * **Wenye maovu na vurugu**  - Itakuwa rahisi kusema, "wakawa waovu na wakafanya mambo ya vurugu."
  * **It became so bad**  – It may be clearer to say, "People were behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God."
  * **Ikawa mbaya sana**  - Itaeleweka zaidi kusema, "watu wakawa na tabia ya kuleta madhara na kufanya maovu mengi mpaka Mungu…"
  * **God decided to destroy**  - This does not mean that the earth would be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and the birds.
  * **Mungu akaamua kuharibu**  - Hii haimanishi kuwa dunia itaharibiwa kabisha. Lakini Mungu alipanga kuharibu watu wote walioasi kinyume naye na waliosababisha hiyo maovu na vurugu. Hii mafuriko pia itaua wanyama wa nchi kavu wote na ndege wote.
  * **huge flood**  - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops of the highest mountains.
  * **Mafuriko makubwa**  - maji mengi ambayo itafunika dunia, hata mahali ardhi ilikuwa imekauka, na pia ifunike vilele vya milima iliyo mirefu zaidi.
