Then **God** asked, “**Who told you that you were naked**? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and **she gave me the fruit**.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “**The snake tricked me**.”

Kisha **Mungu** akaulizza ' Ni nani alikuambua uko uchi?" Je ulikula lile tunda nililokuambia usilile? Mwanaume akajibu, " ulinipatia huyu mwanamke, **na akanipatia tunda** " kisha Mungu akamuuliza mwanamke, " je umefanya nini ? Mwanamke akajibu, "** nyoka alinidanganya".**
