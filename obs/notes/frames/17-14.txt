==== Translation Notes (Maelezo ya Tafsiri): ====

  * **fighting in David's family**  - This "fighting" was very serious. Among other things, one of his sons murdered another son and tried to take David's place as king while David was still reigning. If possible, use a word that conveys the intensity of this conflict within the family.
  * **vita katika familia ya Daudi**  - Haya "mapigano"  yalikuwa makali sana. Miongoni mwa mambo mengine, mmoja wa wanawe akamuua mwanawe mwingine na akajaribu kuchukua nafasi ya Daudi bado akiwa anatawala. Ikiwezekana, tumia neno ambalo litaonyesha kiwango cha mugogoro huo katika familia ya Daudi.
  * **David's power was greatly weakened**  - This might be translated as, "David became less powerful" or, "David lost much of his authority."
  * **nguvu ya Daudi ilipungua sana**  - Hii inaweza kutafsiriwa kama, "Daudi akawa mdhaifu"  ama, "Daudi alipoteza nyingi ya mamlaka yake."
  * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
  * Hadithi ya Biblia kutoka - Marejeleo haya yaweza kuwa na tofauti kiasi na tafsiri zingine za Biblia.
