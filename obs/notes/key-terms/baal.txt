====== Baal  Baali ======

===== Facts: Maarifa =====

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

Baali lilikuwa ni jina la sanamu aliyekuwa akiabudiwa na vikundi vya watu nchini canaani.

  * The name "Baal" means "lord." The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the true Lord.
  * Jina "Baali" linamaanisha "bwana." Kuomba Baali ilikuwa kwa hivyo ni changamoto kubwa kwa mamlaka ya Yahweh, yeye pele aliye Bwana wa ukweli.
  * The Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * WaIsraeli walitenda dhambi pia kwa kuabudu Baali.
  * There were 450 prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab. The prophet Elijah set up a test for the prophets of Baal and proved that their god does not exist. As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and worshiped only Yahweh for a period of time.
  * Kulikuwa na manabii 450 wa Baali katika ufalme wa Israeli kaskazini wakati wa enzi ya Mfalme Ahabu. Nabii Elia alipanga jaribio ya manabii wa Baali na kuthibitisha kwamba mungu wao haishi. Mwishowe, watu waliwauwa manabii wa Baali na kumuabudu tu Yahweh kwa muda.
