As the boys grew up, Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt. Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau. Vijana walipoendelea kukua, Yakobo alipendelea kukaa nyumbani, lakini Esau alipendelea kuwinda. Rebeka alimpenda Yakobo, lakini Isaka alimpenda Esau.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, "Please give me some of the food you have made." Jacob responded, "First, give me your rights as the oldest son." So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food. Siku moja, wakati Esau alirudi kutoka kwa uwindaji, alikuwa na njaa sana. Esau akasema na Yakobo, "tafadhali nipatia baadhi ya chakula kile umetengeneza." Yakobo akamjibu, " Kwanza, nipatie haki zako kama mwana mzaliwa wa kwanza." Hivyo Esau akampatia Yakobo haki zake kama Mwana mzaliwa wa kwanza. Halafu Yakobo akamptatia yeye baadhi ya chakula.

Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau's clothes and put goatskins on his neck and hands. - Isaka alitaka kumpatia Esau baraka zake. Lakini kabla afanye hivyo, Rebeka na Yakobo wakamdanganya kwa kumfanya Yakobo ajifanye kuwa Esau. Isaka alikuwa mkongwe sana na hangeweza kuona tena. Kwa hivyo Yakobo akavaa Mavazi ya Esau na akaweka ngozi ya mbuzi shingoni na mikononi mwake.

Jacob came to Isaac and said, "I am Esau. I have come so that you can bless me." When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him. Yakobo akamjia Isaka na akasema, " mimi ni Esau. Nimekuja ndiposa unibariki mimi." Wakati Isaka aliguza nywele ya mbuzi na kunusa harufu ya nguo, akafikiri ilikuwa ni Esau na akambariki.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died. Esau alimchukia Yakobo kwa sababu Yakobo aliiba haki zake kama mwana mzaliwa wa kwanza pamoja na baraka zake.  Kwa hivyo, alipanga kumuua Yakobo baada ya baba yake kufariki.

But Rebekah heard of Esau's plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.

Jacob lived with Rebekah's relatives for many years. During that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy. Yakobo aliishi na jamaa za Rebeka kwa miaka mingi.  Kwa wakati huo akaoa na akawa na wana wa kiume kumi na wawili na binti mmoja.  Mungu akamfanya kuwa tajiri sana.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals. Baada ya miaka ishirini mbali na nyumbani mwake huko Kanaani, Yakobo akarudi huko pamoja na jamii yake, watumishi wake, na makundi ya wanyama wake wote.

Jacob was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, "Your servant, Jacob, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon." Yakobo aliogopa sana kwa sababu alifikiria eti Esau bado alitaka kumuua.  Hivyo akatuma makundi ya wanyama kwa Esau kama zawadi.  Watumishi walioleta wanyama Wakasema na Esau, "Mtumishi wako, Yakobo, anakupatia wanyama hawa. Yeye anakuja hivi karibuni."

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham now passed on from Isaac to Jacob.
