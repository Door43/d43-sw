====== church, Church ======


===== Definition: =====

The word, "church" refers to a group of people who believe in Jesus. When those believers are in a local area such as a city or a region, it is written as, "church." When it refers to believers everywhere, it is written as, "Church."

    * The original meaning of the word for "church" in the Bible is "called out (to meet together)."
    * "Church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" of believers. The word "congregation" has a similar meaning. However, the believers are still the "church" even when they are not together.
    * In the Bible, the word "church" always refers to Christian believers, and never to a building.
    * The church meets together to pray, teach God's truth, and encourage each other to live in a way that is pleasing to God.
    * God also calls his people, the Church, to go out and teach the good message about Jesus.
