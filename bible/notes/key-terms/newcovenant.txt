====== New Covenant ======


===== Definition: =====

God made a covenant with Israel through his prophet Moses, and later promised that he would make a New Covenant.

  * The New Covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of everyone.
  * This New Covenant came into effect when God's Son died and came back to life.
  * Believers keep the New Covenant by trusting God to forgive them and save them because of the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus.
  * God writes the New Covenant on the hearts of believers. As a result of this, Christians want to obey God, and they begin to live holy lives that demonstrate that God is working in them.
  * The New Covenant will be fulfilled when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will dwell with him in peace, love, and harmony.
