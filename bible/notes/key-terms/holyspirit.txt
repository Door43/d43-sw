The Holy Spirit is God. The one true God exists eternally as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All three are equal in every way.

  * The Holy Spirit was active, along with the Father and the Son, in creating the world.\\ 
  * In the past the Holy Spirit sometimes came to people briefly to give them a special message or to enable them to do great things.\\
