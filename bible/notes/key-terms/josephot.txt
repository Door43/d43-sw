====== Joseph (OT) ======


===== Facts: =====


Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob and the first son of his mother Rachel.

    * Joseph was his father's favorite son so his brothers were jealous of him; they sold him into slavery.
    * Joseph went through difficult times, including being a slave and a prisoner in Egypt, yet he remained faithful to God.
    * God brought him to the second highest place of power in Egypt and used him to save Egypt, and his father's family, from starving.
