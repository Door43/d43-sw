====== filled with the Spirit ======

===== Definition: =====


"Filled with the Spirit" is a figure of speech meaning "controlled" or "empowered" by the Holy Spirit.

    * When a person is filled with the Spirit, the Holy Spirit guides the person and enables him to do what God wants.
    * "He was filled with the Spirit" can also be translated as "His heart was filled with the Holy Spirit" or, "The Holy Spirit lived in him" or, "He had the Holy Spirit." Other ways to translate this are "He was controlled by the Spirit" or, "The Holy Spirit was controlling him." But make sure it does not sound like the Holy Spirit was forcing the person to do something.
