====== fellowship ======

===== Definition: =====

In general, fellowship consists of friendly interactions between members of a group of people who share similar interests and experiences. In the Bible, the term "fellowship" is usually used in reference to the unity of believers in Christ.

  * Christian fellowship is a shared relationship that believers have with one another through their relationship with Christ and the Holy Spirit. It involves showing hospitality and providing community.
  * The early Christians expressed their fellowship through listening to the teaching of God's Word and praying together, through the sharing of their belongings and eating meals together.
  * Christians also have fellowship with God through their faith in Jesus and his sacrificial death on the cross which removed the barrier between God and people.
  * This could also be translated as "a sharing together" or "relationship" or "companionship".
