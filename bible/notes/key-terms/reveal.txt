====== reveal, revelation ======

===== Definition: =====

To reveal something is to cause it to be seen or known. In the Bible, a revelation is revealed or disclosed to people by God.

  * God reveals himself to people through everything he has created.
  * God also reveals himself through everything he has taught us in his written Word.
  * In the context of Galatians 1, Paul refers to receiving the gospel by "revelation from Jesus Christ," which means that Jesus is the one who explained the gospel to him; he did not receive this knowledge from anyone else.
  * Sometimes God reveals himself by speaking audibly to someone, as Jesus did to Paul on the road to Damascus or in the vision that John recorded in the book of Revelation.
  * Other ways to translate "reveal" could include, "make known" or "disclose" or "show clearly."
  * Depending on the context, possible ways to translate "revelation" could be, "communication from God" or "things that God has revealed" or "teachings from God."
