====== idol ======


===== Definition: =====

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it.

  * People make idols to represent the gods that they worship.
  * These false gods do not exist--there is no God besides Yahweh. Therefore the idols have no power.
  * Sometimes things happen by coincidence that make idols seem to have power. Sometimes demons work through idols in order to deceive people.
  * Idols are often made of precious materials like gold or silver.
