====== threshing floor ======

===== Definition: =====

A threshing floor is a place for separating food grain from the unwanted chaff and straw.

  * In biblical times, "threshing floors" were made of a large flat rock or packed down dirt, giving a hard, level surface to collect the threshed grain.
  * Plants to be threshed were first beaten (or trampled by oxen) to separate the straw from the grain and the chaff. Then the grain and chaff were tossed into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away while the grain fell back down on the threshing floor.
