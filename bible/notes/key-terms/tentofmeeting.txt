====== Tent of Meeting ======


===== Facts: =====

When God gave his laws at Mount Sinai, he told the Israelites to make the Tent of Meeting. This was the holy place where he would meet with them. As they wandered through the wilderness, they would take it with them and set it up whenever God told them to do so.

  * The Tent of Meeting was like a house made of cloth stretched over a wooden framework. 
  * God told the people to set up the Tent of Meeting in the middle of a large courtyard surrounded by walls made of cloth and wood. 
  * God told them to put the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting in the middle of the courtyard. The people could go into the courtyard to give offerings and sacrifices to God. The priests who were on duty would receive what the people brought and then offer it on the altar for a sacrifice as the law required. 
  * The Tent of Meeting had a thick curtain hanging in the middle of it, which divided it into two rooms. The curtain was used as barrier to keep people from seeing the room on the other side, and to keep people from going into it. The first room was very holy, so only the priests could go into it. The second room was the most holy place, so only the high priest could go into it.
