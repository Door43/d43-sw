====== yeast ======


===== Definition: =====


Yeast is used in making bread or other baked goods. Yeast creates gas bubbles that make the baked items rise, becoming fluffy, or less dense.


    * Yeast is often compared to sin in the Bible, but not always. Yeast is also compared to the kingdom of God.
    * The Jews do not use leaven in bread during annual Passover celebrations as a reminder of their rapid departure from Egypt when there was no time to wait for the bread to rise before baking.
