====== trust ======


===== Definition: =====


To trust someone or something is to believe that they are reliable, honest, true, and dependable.


    * Trust is closely related to faith. We trust someone because we have faith that they will do what they promised to do.
    * Trusting in Jesus means believing that he is God, believing that his sacrificial death on the cross paid for our sins, and depending on him to save us.
    * Often people foolishly trust in themselves, other people, or things to meet their needs, even though these cannot bring them the good that they desire.
