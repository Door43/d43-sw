====== Pilate ======


===== Facts: =====

Pilate was the Roman governor who sentenced Jesus to death.

  * Because Pilate was the governor, he had the authority to put criminals to death.
  * The Jewish religious leaders wanted Pilate to crucify Jesus, so they lied and said that Jesus was a criminal.
  * Pilate realized that Jesus was not guilty, but he was afraid of the crowd, so he ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus.
