====== testimony ======


===== Definition: =====


Testimony is the evidence provided to support a fact or claim. It can be verbal or written.


    * In the first five books of the Old Testament, "testimony" is another word for the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, the ark of the covenant which held them, or the tabernacle (tent of meeting) which housed the ark.
    * In the remainder of the Old Testament, testimony is used to refer to God's rules, statutes, and laws.
    * In the New Testament, testimony is used of evidence which bears witness of the life and works of Christ as facts, and as a witness of that living truth in the life of Christ followers. It sometimes has a negative sense for those who do not want to accept this truth.
