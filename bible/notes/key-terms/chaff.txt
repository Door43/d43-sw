====== chaff ======


===== Definition: =====


Chaff is a thin, dry protective covering of a cereal grain seed. The grain seed is good for food; the chaff is not. So people separate the chaff from the seed and throw it away. 


    * People separate the chaff from the seed by putting the grain into a container and throwing it up into the air. The wind blows the chaff away and the seed falls on the ground.
