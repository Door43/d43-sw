====== Lord God ======

===== Facts: =====

The Lord God is a title for God.

  * The word "lord" means someone who has ownership or authority over people.
  * God's personal name is Yahweh. The Old Testament sometimes refers to Him as "Yahweh God" or "Yahweh our God."
  * After the Old Testament was written, the Jews stopped saying the name Yahweh because God's name is holy and they did not want to disrespect it. They said "Lord" instead.
  * Those who wrote the New Testament did not write "Yahweh God". Instead, they wrote "the Lord God" or "the Lord our God."
  * In the Old Testament, it can be translated as "Yahweh God" or "the God, Yahweh." In both the Old and New Testaments it can also be translated as, "the Lord God" or "God, the Lord."
  * When these titles for God are combined, they emphasize that God is both "Lord" and "God" or "Yahweh" and "God."
