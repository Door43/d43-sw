====== word ======

===== Definition: =====

A "word" refers to something that someone has said.

  * An example of this would be when the angel told Zechariah "You did not believe my words" which means "You did not believe what I said."
  * This term almost always refers to an entire message, not just one word.
  * Often in the Bible, "the word" refers to everything God has said or commanded, as in "the word of God" or "word of truth"
  * Sometimes "word" refers to speech in general such as "powerful in word and deed" which means "powerful in speech and behavior."
  * A very special use of this term is when Jesus is called "the Word."

Different ways of translating "word" include, "teaching," "message," "news", "a saying" or "what was said." Expressions like "Don't say a word" could be translated as, "Don't say anything."
