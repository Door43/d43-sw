====== sacrifice, offering ======


===== Definition: =====


A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.

    * The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.
    * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.
