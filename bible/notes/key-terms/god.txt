====== God ======

===== Facts: =====

There is only one God. He is the eternal one. He alone existed before anything else, and he will continue to exist forever. He created the universe and all living beings, and he has all authority over everything. He is infinitely wise and infinitely powerful. The one God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

  * As creator and sustainer of the universe, God provides for everything in his creation.
  * God is perfectly righteous, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
  * People were created to worship God and he is the only God they should worship. All other "gods" are false.
  * Because God is holy and just, he must punish sin; yet in his mercy he has provided the way for people to be saved from that punishment, through Jesus.
  * God is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
  * God reveals himself through his creation and through the Bible.
  * God revealed his name as, "Yahweh."
  * Other ways that the Bible refers to God include, "Most High God" or "Holy One" or "Father" or "Lord God."
  * The word "god" is also used to refer to false gods and idols that people worship. Many translations that use the Roman alphabet distinguish these by capitalizing the first letter of the word for the one true God. Another way to do this would be to use a different word for the one true God than for the false gods that people worship.
  * Ways to translate "God" might possibly include, "Supreme Creator" or "Infinite Sovereign Lord" or "Eternal Supreme Being." There may also already be a word for "God" in the target language or in a related language.
