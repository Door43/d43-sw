====== Ananias of Damascus ======

===== Facts: =====

Ananias was a believer in Jesus who lived in the city of Damascus during the time of the early Church.

  * In a vision, Jesus told Ananias to go help a man named Saul who had just become a believer in Christ on the way to Damascus.
  * Saul had become blind, so Ananias prayed for Saul to get his sight back and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
  * This is a different man than the Ananias who lived in Jerusalem.
  * Some translators may want to spell the names of these men a little differently from each other, to make it clear that they were two different people.
