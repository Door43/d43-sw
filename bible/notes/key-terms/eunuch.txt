====== eunuch ======

===== Definition: =====

A eunuch is a man who has been castrated, though the term later came to simply mean a government official, even those who had not been castrated.

  * In ancient times, these men were often kings' servants who were set as guards over the women's quarters (as in the story of Esther).
  * Some eunuchs were important government officials, as is probable in the New Testament account of the Ethiopian eunuch that Philip encountered.
