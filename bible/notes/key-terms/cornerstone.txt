====== cornerstone ======

===== Definition: =====

In ancient times, a cornerstone was the first stone that was placed for the foundation of a building. All the other stones would be placed in reference to the cornerstone, which determined the position of the whole building.

  * The cornerstone was usually the most sturdy, solid and well-formed stone of the structure and was very carefully placed. to ensure that the whole building would have a secure foundation.
  * Jesus Christ is called the "cornerstone" for the Church, that is, for all those who believe in him. This is a figure of speech that means he is the stable foundation on which our faith is built.
  * Translation suggestions: "key foundation stone" or "most important foundation rock." Make sure the word "stone" is understood to be a large stone. There may be another word that could be used that means "large stone" (such as "boulder")  but it should also have the idea of being well-formed and made to fit.
