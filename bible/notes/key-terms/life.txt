====== life, live, living, alive  ======



===== Definition: =====

There are two ways that "life" is used in the Bible--"physical life" and "spiritual life." The types of "life" are similar in some respects, but there are also important differences between them. 

=== 1. Physical life ===


    * Physical life is the presence of the spirit in the body. God breathed life into Adam's body, and he became a living being.
    * A "life" can also refer to an individual person, as in, "several lives were saved".
    * Sometimes the word "life" refers to the experience of living, as in, "made their lives miserable" or to one's lifespan as in, "toward the end of his life."
    * To be "living" may refer to being alive or to be residing somewhere.
    * The opposite of "life" is "death."


=== 2. Spiritual life ===


    * Spiritual life refers to presence of the person with God.
    * This life is also called "eternal life" to indicate that it does not end.
    * The opposite of spiritual life is spiritual death, which means being separated from God and experiencing eternal punishment.
