====== Baal ======


===== Facts: =====


Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

    * The name "Baal" means "lord." The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the true Lord.
    * The Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
    * There were 450 prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab. The prophet Elijah set up a test for the prophets of Baal and proved that their god does not exist. As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and worshiped only Yahweh for a period of time.
