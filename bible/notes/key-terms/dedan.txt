====== Dedan ======

===== Facts: =====

There were two different men named Dedan in the Bible.

  * The great-grandson of Noah's son Ham was named Dedan.
  * The grandson of Abraham and his wife Keturah was also named Dedan.
  * In the Bible, the descendants of Dedan are referred to as the "Dedanites" or sometimes just, "Dedan."
  * The region where the Dedanites lived is sometimes referred to as "Dedan" in the Bible; it also says that the Dedanites lived in Arabia.
  * Some translators may want to spell Dedan differently in different contexts in a translation to make sure it is clear that there were two different people by this name.
  * When it refers to a place this could be translated as, "the region of Dedan."
