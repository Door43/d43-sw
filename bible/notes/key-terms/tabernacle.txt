====== tabernacle ======

===== Definition: =====

The tabernacle was a special tent that God told the Israelites to construct as a place for them to worship him during the 40 years that they wandered in the desert, as they traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land. This tent was the place where God dwelled among them.

  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle when King Solomon had the temple built in Jerusalem.</font>

  * The tent itself was divided into two rooms: the "holy place" where, among other things, the altar for burning incense was located and the "most holy place" where the ark of the covenant was kept.
  * The courtyard of the tabernacle had a special washbasin for ritual cleansing and an altar for burning animal sacrifices.
  * The word “tabernacle” means "dwelling place." Other ways to translate it would be "tent of meeting" or "tent sanctuary."
