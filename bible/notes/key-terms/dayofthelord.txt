====== day of the Lord ======

===== Description: =====

The phrase "day of the Lord" refers to a time when there will be a final judgment of all who have rebelled against God.

  * This final judgment will include destruction of the earth. The resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous will also happen at this time.
  * At the time of the "day of the Lord," God will be exalted and everyone will know and acknowledge that he is the Lord.
  * This final time of judgment and resurrection is also known as the "last day". For example, Jesus promised his followers that he would raise them to life "on the last day".
  * The day of the Lord cannot be predicted or known before it comes. Jesus said it would come as unexpectedly as a "thief in the night".
