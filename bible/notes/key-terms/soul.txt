====== soul ======

===== Definition: =====

The soul is the inner, invisible, and eternal part of a person. It is sometimes used instead of "spirit".

  * Soul refers to the non-physical part of a person, including the mind, will and emotions.
  * The soul is a person's "true self" or "inner person."
  * Only humans have souls; there are no references to animals having souls.
  * In the Bible, the word “soul” is also used to refer to a person, his nature, or his eternal existence.
  * The “soul” makes a human being alive. When a person dies, his soul leaves his body.
