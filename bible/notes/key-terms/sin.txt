====== sin, sinful, sinner ======


===== Definition: =====


Sin is any action that is contrary to what God wants. It also refers to the nature that every human is born with.


    * We can sin by active disobedience (rebellion), or by inaction (failing to do something that God wants us to do).
    * We also sin when we think about doing things that do not please God.
    * "To sin" can be translated as "to disobey God" or "to do wrong."
    * Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, whether other people know about it or not.
    * Even though everyone is a sinner, the word "sinner" is sometimes used to refer to people who are known for their wicked deeds.
    * "Sinful" can also be translated as "wicked" or "immoral" or "evil."


Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat. Prior to that act there was no sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to child through the entire human race. God must punish sin.
