====== Jesus ======


===== Facts: =====

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins.

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.
  * Jesus lived a perfect life. He obeyed his parents, obeyed God, and never sinned.
  * Jesus taught people about the kingdom of God.
  * Jesus healed many people, made demons leave people, and did many other miraculous things. This helped to prove that his teaching was from God and that it was true.
  * Though Jesus never sinned, he was killed as a criminal and took the punishment for people's sins.
  * Three days after he died, Jesus came to life again and taught people more about the kingdom of God.
  * Then Jesus returned to heaven and now rules with his Father. He is also our great high priest, who speaks to the Father in our favor.
  * Jesus is the Messiah. Someday he will return and will reign as king over all the earth.
