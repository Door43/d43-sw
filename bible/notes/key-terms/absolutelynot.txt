====== may it never be, God forbid, absolutely not ======

===== Definition: =====

This term is a strong expression of emphasizing that something is not true or that there is a strong desire for it to never happen. Often it is used in response to a rhetorical question. [TA Rhetorical Questions]

  * When used by Paul, this is the strongest way of saying that what he is speaking about can never happen or must never happen.
  * If he says Jesus can "absolutely not" cause anyone to sin, he means it is impossible for Jesus to cause anyone to sin. This could be translated as "That is completely impossible!" or "Of course that is not true!"
  * If Paul says, "may it never be that I should sin," he means it is his fervent desire and wish that he not sin. This could be translated as, "May God help me to never do that!"
