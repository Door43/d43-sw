====== sheep ======


===== Definition: =====

A sheep is a medium-sized animal with four legs that has wool all over its body.

  * People eat meat from sheep and use their wool to make clothing and other things.
  * Sheep are very trusting, weak and timid. They are easily influenced to wander away. They need a shepherd to lead them in the right direction and to provide them with food, water and shelter.
  * In the Bible, people are compared to sheep who have God as their shepherd.
