====== fruit ======


===== Definition: =====


Fruit is the edible food produced by a plant. In the Bible fruit is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to a person's works. These works reflect the person's inward spiritual condition.


    * Just as a good plant produces good fruit, a good spiritual condition produces good works.
    * The Bible lists the fruit that God's Spirit produces in the lives of those who obey him: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness and self control.
