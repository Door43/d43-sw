====== lamb, Lamb of God ======


===== Definition: =====


In the Bible, a lamb is a young sheep or goat. A sheep is a four-legged animal with a thick woolly hair. People raise them for their wool or as a source of food. Sheep are defenseless and timid. Goats are similar animals, and are used mainly for food. 

    * God's people used to sacrifice sheep and lambs to Him. The ones they sacrificed had to be physically perfect, with no defects.
    * Jesus is called the "Lamb of God" because he was morally perfect--completely without sin--and his sacrifice paid for people's sins.
