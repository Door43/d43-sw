====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

To hope is to desire that something will happen. When hope is talked about in the Bible, it often refers to a sure expectation that God will bring about what he has promised.

  * The word "hope" can mean to wish for something without really knowing whether or not it will happen. For example, we might say, "I hope it will rain tomorrow". There is a desire for it to rain, but no guarantee that it will actually rain.
  * In the Bible, however, "hope" usually refers to trusting in God, expecting him to protect us and provide for us. There is an assurance that what is hoped for will happen.
  * The ultimate hope is being assured of our salvation through our faith in Christ. Peter calls this our "living hope",
  * Depending on what meaning it has in the text, "to hope" can also be translated as "to desire" or "to expect" or "to wish" or "to trust" or "to be assured of".
  * Some ways to translate "a hope" might be, "an expectation" or "an assurance" or "a wish" or "a desire".
