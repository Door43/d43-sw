====== bewitched, evil eye ======

===== Definition: =====

The literal meaning of the terms "bewitched" or "evil eye" have to do with witchcraft and casting demonic spells. In the Bible however, these terms are not used this way but rather have a figurative meaning.

  * As used in Galatians 3:1, to be "bewitched with an evil eye" is an idiom meaning to be "deceived" or to be "led astray from the truth."
  * It also implies that someone has lost the ability to reason correctly or that he is not thinking clearly.
  * Ways to translate "bewitched you" could include "deceived you" or "tricked you" or "led you astray."
  * The term "evil eye" in the Bible usually refers to someone who is "greedy" or "stingy" or "not generous."
  * Sometimes having an evil eye can refer to being envious or covetous.
