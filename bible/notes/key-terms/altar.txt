An altar is a raised structure on which sacrifices were burned as gifts, or offerings, to God. 

    * Altars were often made by packing together a mound of earth or by carefully placing stones into a large pile. 
    * Some special altars were made of metal, such as gold or bronze.
    * God told his people to build altars on which to make sacrifices to him, and the nations around Israel also built altars to make sacrifices to their gods.
