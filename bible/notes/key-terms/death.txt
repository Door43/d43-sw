====== death, die, dead ======


===== Definition: =====


The term "death" is used in two different ways in the Bible. It sometimes refers to when the physical body of a person ceases to live. It is also used for the spiritual separation of sinners from a holy God.


=== 1. Physical death ===


    * To die is to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.
    * A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.
    * Physical death is the result of the sin of Adam and Eve.


=== 2. Spiritual death ===


    * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.
    * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.
    * Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.


"Death" is the opposite of "life". In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death.
