===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **after blindfolding him** - "after they covered his eyes so that he could not see"
    * **Prophesy! Who is the one that hit you?** - The guards thought that a real prophet would be able to tell who hit him even if he could not see it. They wanted to show that Jesus was not a prophet. It can be translated as “Prove that you are a prophet. Tell us who hit you” or “Hey prophet, who hit you?” 
    * **Prophesy!**  - "Speak words from God!" The implied information is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him since Jesus was blindfolded and could not see. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]])
