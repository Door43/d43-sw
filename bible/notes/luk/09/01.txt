===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the twelve **- This is the group of disciples that Jesus chose to be his apostles.
  * **power and authority**- These two terms are used together to show that the twelve had both the ability and the right to heal people. Translate this phrase with a combination of words that include both of these ideas.
  * **diseases**  - "sicknesses." This refers to what makes a person sick.
  * **sent them out**  - This could be translated as "sent them to various places" or "told them to go."
