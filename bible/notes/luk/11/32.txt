\v 32 The men who lived in the ancient city of Nineveh turned from their sinful ways when Jonah preached to them. And now I, who am greater than Jonah, have come and preached to you, but you have not turned from your sinful ways. Therefore, at the time when God judges all people, the men who lived in Nineveh long ago will stand there and condemn the people alive now. "

===== Translation Notes: =====



  * **for they repented** - The men of Nineveh repented.
  * **and behold, someone greater**  - The word "behold" alerts us to the importance of the person who is greater than Jonah in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There is someone who is even greater...” When Jesus said this, he was talking about himself.
  * **someone greater than Jonah is here** - The rebuke Jesus wanted them to understand was “but you have not repented.”
