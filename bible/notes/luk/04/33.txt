    * **he cried out with a loud voice**  - "he shouted loudly." Some languages have an idiom for this like the English idiom "he shouted at the top of his lungs." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom]])
    * **What do we have to do with you?** - This could be translated as "What do we have in common?" or "We have nothing to do with you!" It is a belligerent response that means "You have no right to bother us!"
