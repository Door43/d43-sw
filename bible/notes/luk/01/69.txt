===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Zechariah continues to prophesy.)
    * **his servant David **- "King David, who served him"
    * **just as God spoke** - Here, this could be translated as "That is what God promised he would do when he."
    * **spoke through his holy prophets** - This could be translated as "caused his holy prophets to say" (UDB). When God spoke through the prophets, they used their own voices, but God enabled them to speak the words he wanted them to.
    * **enemies..all who hate us** - This is a doublet in which "enemies" and "all who hate us" both refer to those who are against God's people. This could be translated as "people who fight against us and want to harm us." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet]])
    * **hand** - "power" or "control." This is a metonymy in which "hand" is associated with the power or control that is being used to harm God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
